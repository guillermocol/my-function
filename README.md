# my-function
test

It was great to catch up with you yesterday. As discussed, the following is the task:

Create a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions (or, similar) that can deploy a serverless "hello world" application written in any language to Amazon lambda (Or EC2/containers if you prefer). Use AWS credentials (environment variables) to connect and deploy. In the script, use reusable 'actions'/'orbs' to promote reuse. The CI/CD script should deploy, start the application and run tests.



you could leverage work from: https://github.com/ravivamsi/postmanframework, or anywhere else



Talking points & Bonus:

Clear explanation on what was done and how (navigation of code). Anything over and above this (deployment, Security, performance, documentation, ...)



Estimated time for this is around 4 hours. I'll be looking at what tools you used, what choices you made and how you went about piecing together this task. You can create free accounts and make any assumptions that you feel are valid in this scenario. Good luck!


Regards
